# Overview

This is a very simple gRPC server that listens on `localhost` at port `6666`.

# Structure

* [sdk](sdk) - Contains the generated go files from protoc. They can be generated by [protoc-tool.sh](../api/protoc-tool.sh).
* [server/server.go](server/server.go) - Contains the code for the GO server.
* [client.sh](client.sh) - A very simple client for testing the gRPC server.
* [grpc_server.go](grpc_server.go) - The gRPC server main entry point.

# Prerequisites

You need:

* [golang](https://golang.org/)
* [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) - Optional, only used by the client
tester script.
